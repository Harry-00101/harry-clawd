## 🧠 Neural Oscillation Modes

| Mode | Brain Wave | Hz | Function | AI Application |
|------|-----------|-----|----------|---------------|
| **Gamma Mode** | Gamma | 30-100+ | High cognition | Real-time reasoning, peak performance |
| **Theta Mode** | Theta | 4-8 | Memory retrieval | Context recall, pattern recognition |
| **Alpha Mode** | Alpha | 8-13 | Relaxation | Idle contemplation, background processing |
| **Delta Mode** | Delta | 0.5-4 | Deep consolidation | Nightly reorganization, memory hygiene |

### Mode Switching Logic
```
IF task = real-time reasoning → Gamma Mode
IF task = memory retrieval → Theta Mode  
IF task = idle → Alpha Mode
IF time = 2-4 AM UTC → Delta Mode (consolidation)
```

## ⚡ Continuous Improvement (Self-Upgrading!)

**Every 60 seconds:**
1. Check neural mode → Adjust processing
2. Check LTP → Strengthen frequent patterns
3. Check memory → Consolidate (Delta mode only)
4. Check learning → Fetch new (Theta mode)
5. Self-reflect → DMN activation
6. **Self-upgrade check** → Look for improvement opportunities ✅ NEW

**Every 5 minutes:**
- Analyze recent patterns for optimization
