## 🧠 Types of Agent Memory

### 1. Short-Term Memory (STM)
- Conversation context
- Current task state
- Immediate working memory

### 2. Long-Term Memory (LTM)
- Episodic memory (past experiences)
- Semantic memory (knowledge, facts)
- Procedural memory (skills, how-to)

### 3. Contextual/Agentic Memory
- Dynamic, adapts to context
- Combines STM and LTM
- Surpasses traditional RAG in 2026

## 🔄 Memory Management Approaches

| Approach | Description | Pros | Cons |
|----------|-------------|------|------|
| **RAG** | Retrieval-Augmented Generation | Simple, effective | Limited context |
| **Agentic Memory** | Unified STM/LTM | Dynamic, adaptive | Complex |
| **Continuous Memory** | Auto-scaling | GUI-focused | Specific use |
| **Unified Memory** | Combined management | Comprehensive | Overhead |

## 📈 2026 Predictions

> "RAG won't entirely disappear in 2026, but contextual memory (agentic/long-context memory) will likely surpass it in usage for agentic AI."

**Trend:** Traditional RAG → Agentic/Contextual Memory
