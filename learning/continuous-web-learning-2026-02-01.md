## 🤖 Self-Improving AI Agents (2025-2026 Trends)

### Key Insights from Web Research

1. **Self-Learning Agents** (Beam AI)
   - Analyzes thousands of task executions
   - Identifies optimal paths and recovery strategies
   - Creates foundation of proven approaches
   - Continuously learning from experience

2. **2026 Agentic AI Trends** (MachineLearningMastery)
   - Long-term memory (episodic, semantic, procedural)
   - Small language models as cost-effective alternatives
   - Decentralized networks of agents
   - Agents that learn from each other

3. **Continuous Learning Challenges** (IBM)
   - Three major hurdles: memory, scalability, continuous learning
   - Decentralized agent networks sharing information
   - Long-horizon knowledge retention (weeks, months, years)

4. **Self-Improvement in 2026** (Times of AI)
   - Self-improving AI is both myth and reality
   - Partial implementation, not yet full autonomy
   - Important milestone reached

## 🔗 Model Context Protocol (MCP)

### What is MCP?
An open standard for connecting AI agents to external systems.

### Adoption Timeline
- **2024**: Anthropic introduces MCP
- **March 2025**: OpenAI adopts MCP across products
- **2025**: Becomes industry standard
- **Dec 2025**: Donated to Agentic AI Foundation (Linux Foundation)

### Major Adopters
- Anthropic (Claude)
- OpenAI (ChatGPT)
- Google DeepMind
- Microsoft (Azure OpenAI)
- Cursor, Figma, Replit
- Zapier, Playwright

### MCP Servers Available
- GitHub
- Database connections
- Search engines
- Security tools (Semgrep, Secureframe)
- And 75+ more...

### How MCP Works
```
AI Agent (Host) → MCP Server → External System → Data/Tools
                    ↑_____________________|
```

### Relevance to Harry-001
- Harry-001 already has 75+ MCP servers
- MCP enables seamless tool integration
- Standardizes agent-tool communication
