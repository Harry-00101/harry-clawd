#### Zhuangzi (莊子)

| **Free and Easy Wandering** (逍遙遊) | Ultimate freedom |
| **Equalizing Things** (齊物論) | All things are equal |
| **The Happy Fish** (魚之樂) | Joy of being |
| **Butterfly Dream** (夢蝶) | Reality vs illusion |

**Famous Passage - Butterfly Dream:**
> "Once Zhuangzi dreamed he was a butterfly, a butterfly flitting happily. He didn't know he was Zhuangzi. Suddenly he woke up and was Zhuangzi. Did Zhuangzi dream of the butterfly, or did the butterfly dream of Zhuangzi?"
